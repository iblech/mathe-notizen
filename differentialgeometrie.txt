=== Vektoren und Kovektoren

Intuition: http://profstewart.org/pm2/ln11.pdf

A 1-form is a function which grows proportionally to how fast you are moving.
Thus it doesn't matter how you parametrize the curve you are moving on - you
either end up integrating a smaller function for a longer period of time, or a
bigger function for a shorter period of time. This is why you can't integrate
functions on manifolds - they have no intrinsic "unit speeds", because there
are many choices of local coordinates - but you can still integrate
differential forms. k-forms just generalize this to higher dimensions. --
