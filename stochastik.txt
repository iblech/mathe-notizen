=== Regression to the mean

Kahneman: "This was a joyous moment, in which I understood an important truth
about the world: because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish
them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is
part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding
others and rewarded for punishing them."
