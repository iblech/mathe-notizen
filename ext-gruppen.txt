David Ben-Zi in [1]:
The higher cohomology groups of the structure sheaf (in any context) precisely
capture the category of sheaves which are generated by the structure sheaf --
i.e. all sheaves which can be made by taking complexes built out of copies of
the structure sheaf with arbitrary morphisms between them. Namely this
(differential graded) category is equivalent to (dg) modules over the (dg)
algebra made out of the cohomologies (or more precisely the self-Ext complex -
ie the complex calculating the cohomology groups) of the structure sheaf.

In other words, if you want to make global sections into a (derived)
equivalence you have to on the one hand restrict to sheaves generated by the
structure sheaf and on the other consider the target of global sections not
just vector spaces (or complexes) but rather modules over the Ext algebra of
the structure sheaf (where the sheaf cohomology of any sheaf naturally lands).

There's a theorem (see [Keller, On differential graded categories] for the dg
setting, [Schwede-Shipley, Stable model categories are categories of modules]
for the model setting and Lurie, DAG II for the oo-categorical setting) that
"enriched" versions of triangulated categories which are generated by a single
object are equivalent to modules over the endomorphisms of the object (for
abelian categories this is a standard result about endomorphisms of a
projective generator, don't know what's a standard reference).

In any case if you look at the category generated by the structure sheaf, it
will then be given by modules over derived endomorphisms of O, i.e., over
derived global sections of O, i.e. over "derived global functions"..

Nächste Schritte:
* Ext-Gruppen anschaulich verstehen, zumindest Ext^1.
  Insbesondere auch Zusammenhang zu H^1 (Garbenkohomologie) verstehen.
* Modulstruktur auf Ext^1 verstehen.
* M endlich über A, A noeth. lokaler Ring. Dann: M frei <==> Ext^1(M, A/m) = 0.
* Alte HA-Aufgabe über Fortsetzbarkeit wiederholen.
* Obige Bemerkung von Ben-Zi verstehen:
  a) im abelschen Fall.
  b) im dg-Fall.
