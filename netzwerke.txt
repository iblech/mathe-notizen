Structure of complex networks - A cutting-edge perspective

After an introduction to the basics of power flows in high-voltage transmission
networks, the talk will focus on the effects of line-outages in such power
grids. It will be shown that the post-failure redistribution of the power flows
across the lines provides an edge-centric perspective on power grids and other
complex networks. Such an approach yields information complementary to the
usually adapted node-based view, in particular, on non-local interactions
present in such networks. It will be argued that far-range interactions also
lead to heavy tails in the statistics of the flow redistributions. Finally, a
generalized branching-process model for failure cascades will be presented.
