"And this gave the first practical method of determining longitude, one of the
most pressing scientific problems of 17th century. Jupiter satellites made
possible determination of longitude only on land, because you need a telescope
to see them, and a telescope cannot be installed on a ship. Solution of
longitude problem at sea had to wait for another century, and was obtained in
two ways: a) mathematicians managed to predict Moon's motion, using Newton's
laws and advances in mathematics, and b) chronometer was invented. (A lot of
mathematics was used in both cases, especially for the Moon motion)."
