Which of the senior speaker's courses are you most interested in and why?

I'm most interested in Kuznetsov's and Lazarsfeld's courses:
* My Ph.D. research will deal with symmetric products of derived
  categories; Kuznetsov's course is therefore directly relevant to my work.
* There are two reasons for my interest in Lazarsfeld's course:
  Firstly, the idea of presenting objects by generators and relations (and
  generalizations thereof) will play an important technical role in my research.
  Secondly, constructive mathematics (particularly constructive algebra in the
  sense of Richman, Coquand, Lombardi, ...) is a long-term side interest of me.
  A central theme of constructive algebra is that one shouldn't work with large
  objects (e.g. the field of algebraic numbers) directly, but with finite
  approximations (e.g. certain splitting fields of explicitly given
  polynomials); from this point of view, the concept of syzygies is obviously
  very important.


Which of the courses do you think you will understand the most and why?

I'll probably understand the courses of Kuznetsov and Lazarsfeld the most,
because I'm already familiar with homological algebra, derived categories,
Fourier-Mukai transformations etc. and the classical theory of syzygies.


Please give a short description of your research interests (at most 1 page but
more than "Algebraic geometry". If possible, you should point out connections
to the topics of the senior speakers.)

My main interest is in symmetric products of derived categories and
"categorified linear algebra" (symmetric and exterior products of categories),
but I'm also interested in applications of topos theory to algebraic geometry,
i.e. gaining better understanding of relative situations by using the
intuitionistic internal language of certain topoi, and constructive mathematics
in general.

I'd be happy to provide any additional information required.


Using the internal language of topoi in algebraic geometry

There are several important topoi associated to a scheme, for instance the
petit and gros Zariski topoi. These come with an internal language which
closely resembles the usual formal language of mathematics, but is "local on
the base scheme": For example, the structure sheaf looks like an ordinary local
ring (instead of a sheaf of rings) and vector bundles look like ordinary
ordinary free modules from the internal perspective. In the talk, we'll learn
how this can be exploited to give more conceptual proofs of basic observations
in algebraic geometry.
