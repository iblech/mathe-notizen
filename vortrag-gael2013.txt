Which of the senior speaker's courses are you most interested in and why?
I'm most interested in Kuznetsov's and Lazarsfeld's courses:
A leitmotif for my Ph.D. thesis is the idea of presenting objects by generators
and relations, because I'll be dealing with symmetric products of derived
categories. Kuznetsov's course is therefore directly relevant to my work.

Which of the courses do you think you will understand the most and why?
I'll probably understand the courses of Kuznetsov and Lazarsfeld the most,
because I'm already familiar with derived categories, Fourier-Mukai
transformations etc.

Please give a short description of your research interests (at most 1 page but
more than "Algebraic geometry". If possible, you should point out connections
to the topics of the senior speakers.)
