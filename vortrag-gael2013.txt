Which of the senior speaker's courses are you most interested in and why?

I'm most interested in Kuznetsov's and Lazarsfeld's courses:
* My Ph.D. research will deal with symmetric products of derived
  categories; Kuznetsov's course is therefore directly relevant to my work.
* There are two reasons for my interest in Lazarsfeld's course:
  Firstly, the idea of presenting objects by generators and relations (and
  generalizations thereof) will play an important technical role in my resarch.
  Secondly, constructive mathematics (particularly constructive algebra in the
  sense of Richman, Coquand, Lombardi...) is a long-term side interest of me.
  A central theme of constructive algebra is that one shouldn't work with large
  objects (e.g. the field of algebraic numbers) directly, but with finite
  approximations (e.g. certain splitting fields of explicitly given polynomials).


Which of the courses do you think you will understand the most and why?

I'll probably understand the courses of Kuznetsov and Lazarsfeld the most,
because I'm already familiar with homological algebra, derived categories,
Fourier-Mukai transformations etc. and the classical theory of syzygies.


Please give a short description of your research interests (at most 1 page but
more than "Algebraic geometry". If possible, you should point out connections
to the topics of the senior speakers.)
