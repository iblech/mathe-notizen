* By storing its essential data in photons, life could give itself a
  distributed backup system. And it could go further, manipulating new photons
  emitted by stars to dictate how they interact with matter. Fronts of
  electromagnetic radiation could be reaching across the cosmos to set in
  motion chains of interstellar or planetary chemistry with exquisite timing,
  exploiting wave interference and excitation energies in atoms and molecules.
  The science-fiction writer Stanisław Lem put forward a similar idea,
  involving neutrinos rather than photons, in the novel His Master’s Voice.
