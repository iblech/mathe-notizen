* http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/04HE: Ã‰tale coverings of a scheme can
  be refined by Zariski coverings of finite locally free covers.

* "One-dimensional singularities in general can be really nasty. A good fact to
  always keep in mind is a beautiful theorem of Artin (coming out of his
  approximation theorem): if a pair of finite type schemes over a field kk have
  kk-isomorphic completions at a pair of closed points then (over kk) they even
  share a common (residually trivial) etale neighborhood around those points.
  So working "formally" over kk is tantamount to working "etale-locally" over
  kk, which is pretty amazing. This is in arbitrary dimension."
