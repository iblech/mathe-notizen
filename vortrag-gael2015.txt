Which of the senior speaker's courses are you most interested in and why?

I'm most interested in Fulton's and Taelman's courses.

For Fulton, this is because I'm too interested in Chern classes (of certain
derived bundles with known Chern classes) and in the relations with equivariant
cohomology.

For Taelman, this is because I wanted to understand the trace formular for a
long time and because I hope to gain new impulses for my research, regarding
the interplay between a variety and its derived category.


Which of the courses do you think you will understand the most and why?

I will probably understand Taelman's course the most, as I'm familiar with
derived categories and G-equivariant geometry. Also, his Beijing lecture notes
on the same topic seem to be very accessible.


Mathematical interests

My main interest is in symmetric products of derived categories and
"categorified linear algebra" (symmetric and exterior products of categories).
The main kinds of geometric objects I work with are Hyperk√§hler manifolds.

I'm also interested in applications of topos theory to algebraic geometry, i.e.
gaining better understanding of relative situations by using the intuitionistic
internal language of certain topoi, and constructive mathematics in general.

Please note that I already gave a talk in 2013's GAeL. I understand that you
might want to prefer students who had not yet the chance to talk in front of an
international audience.
