=== James--Stein estimator

The James–Stein estimator is a biased estimator of the mean of Gaussian random
vectors. It can be shown that the James–Stein estimator dominates the
"ordinary" least squares approach, i.e., it has lower mean squared error on
average. It is the best-known example of Stein's phenomenon.
