* "The explanation of this phenomenon is simple: generally speaking, duals of
  nonseparable spaces are highly pathological objects about which little of value
  can be said. This is characteristic of impredicative mathematics generally.
  The extra generality of ZFC is spurious, involving structures which are
  highly pathological from the point of view of mainstream mathematics."

  "The impredicative portion of the universe of ZFC is rife with undecidability,
  and many known undecidable statements are not contrived, but appear quite
  fundamental — the prototype of such a statement being the continuum
  hypothesis."

* Γ_0 ist eventuell gar nicht "die erste nicht-prädikative Ordinalzahl"!

* J_2 ist ein guter Rahmen für Mainstreammathematik:
