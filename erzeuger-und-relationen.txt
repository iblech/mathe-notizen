  Thus the (enhanced) derived category is just dg modules over the ext algebra
  of this generator (or over the small category of generators). Now it's easy
  to see that the external product of generators is a generator for the
  product. Hence sheaves on the product are modules for the tensor product of
  the dg algebras, ie sheaves on the product are the tensor product of
  categories of sheaves on each factor.
